Buttons:
    - if the user has liked the post, only show the unlike button
    - if the user has liked the posit, only show the like button
    - if the user tries to like again or unlike again (via curl request to /posts/?target=URL with operation=like,unlike), 
      we need to abort 409 (via return flask.abort(409))
